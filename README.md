Sametime Web Client - Instant Messaging with IBMers
If you do not have an instant messaging infrastructure in your company, you can use IM with IBMers by  accessing Sametime using your web browser:


1.  Launch your web browser and navigate to http://extstweb.ibm.com/stwebclient/index.jsp
2.  You will need an IBM account. Register one here https://www.ibm.com/account/profile/us?page=reg new accounts are active after approximately 30 minutes

Note - Within the web client, after being logged on for extended periods of time, it is helpful to refresh the logon by clicking the refresh button within the browser.
 

3.  To add contacts to your contact list into your web client

    Within the 'File' menu, select 'New Contact'
    Add external user by E-mail address (IBMers are logged onto a different community environment than the service you are using. Therefore, they are external to your environment.
    Input the email address of the IBMer with whom you want to add to your contact list. Choose the group to which you want to add them. Select Add. (Note - you can only add ibm.com addresses because this service does not support chat with others, i.e. it is not a public chat network.)
    That IBM contact is now included in your contact list with a Globe icon in front of it.
    Double click on the name and send a message and youâ€™ll be chatting using Sametime Gateway for Internet Users.

Sametime client via web browser:

IBM Internal : http://stweb.ibm.com/stwebclient/index.jsp
External : http://extstweb.ibm.com/stwebclient/index.jsp (Need to use this full url, can not shortcut to just extstweb.ibm.com)

Customers outside of IBM use their IBM ID (for ASIC customers they know this as their IBM Customer Connect ID)

NOTE: as an IBM user you can also use the "external" extstweb.ibm.com to login when you are unable to VPN/ATTclient connect to IBM directly, just login with your IBM intranet ID.  The client is a simple client, you will not have your internal contact list, and other IBM internal users will likely not see you as online.
